            <p>A DIPCA executive statement was posted, which can be read below:</p>
            <aside>
                <p>"Thank you so much to everyone who donated to and supported our annual Feed the Shield Program.</p>
                <p>By the grace of God, we were able to provide for 180 deserving families this Ramadan!!</p>
                <p>These are the men and women who spend endless of hours (up to 12 hours a day) in this scorching heat through out Ramadan, with a family and children waiting for them to come home with bread, milk and some play time, they work all day to protect us from from harms way.</p>
                <p>Alhumdullilah, we have been blessed with so much, when everyone puts in the effort, it becomes a lot easier to support those who need it. IA we pray that in the coming years we are able to provide for even more families. No parent should have to shed a tear when their child tells them they are hungry but there is no more bread on the table. The happiness on their faces is our motivation to work harder and expand further."</p>
